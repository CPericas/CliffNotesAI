# ðŸ§  CliffNotes AI â€” Progress Tracker (Building In Progress)

### CliffNotes AI is a lightweight web application that summarizes articles, extracts quotes with contextual speaker attribution, and tracks recent summaries locally.

Recent Summaries: Stores last 5 summaries in localStorage with date, source, summary, and quotes.

Results Display: Summary and quotes rendered in a Bootstrap ListGroup with speaker labels.
